    "indicator": "EMA",
    "description": "The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a moving average that gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information. Compared to the Simple Moving Average (SMA), the EMA reacts faster to recent price changes, helping to capture trends earlier.",
    "use": "EMA is commonly used by traders to identify the direction of a trend. A short-term EMA crossing above a long-term EMA is often seen as a signal to buy, while a cross below is a signal to sell. It smooths out price data and is particularly useful in trending markets to filter out noise."
  },
  {
    "indicator": "SMA",
    "description": "The Simple Moving Average (SMA) calculates the average price of a security over a specific number of periods, giving equal weight to all the prices within the time frame. It helps to smooth out fluctuations in price, showing a more consistent direction of the price movement over time.",
    "use": "SMA is used to determine the overall market trend and identify potential reversal points. When prices move above the SMA, it can indicate a bullish trend, while prices falling below the SMA may signal a bearish trend. It’s often used in combination with other indicators to confirm signals."
  },
  {
    "indicator": "PSAR",
    "description": "The Parabolic Stop and Reverse (PSAR) is a trend-following indicator that highlights potential reversal points in a stock's price. It places dots above or below the price, switching when a trend reversal is likely. Dots below the price suggest a bullish trend, while dots above indicate a bearish trend.",
    "use": "PSAR is typically used to set trailing stop losses. When the dots flip, it signals that the trend direction has changed, offering a cue to exit the trade or enter in the opposite direction. It's especially useful for locking in profits during trending markets."
  },
  {
    "indicator": "Price Channel",
    "description": "The Price Channel indicator plots the highest high and the lowest low over a set period to form an upper and lower band. These bands represent the boundaries of price movement, helping traders to visualize support and resistance levels.",
    "use": "Price Channels are used to identify potential breakout points. A price moving above the upper channel is often seen as a signal of strength, while a price dropping below the lower channel may indicate weakness. It helps in recognizing trends, ranges, and potential reversals."
  },
  {
    "indicator": "Bollinger Bands",
    "description": "Bollinger Bands consist of three lines: a middle line (SMA) and two outer bands that represent the standard deviation of the price data. The width of the bands expands and contracts based on market volatility.",
    "use": "Bollinger Bands are used to measure volatility and potential overbought or oversold conditions. When the price touches the upper band, it may be considered overbought, and when it touches the lower band, it may be oversold. Traders often use this to anticipate price reversals or continuations."
  },
  {
    "indicator": "MACD",
    "description": "The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages, usually the 12-day and 26-day EMAs. The MACD line, signal line, and histogram help traders identify the strength and direction of a trend.",
    "use": "MACD is used to spot changes in trend strength, direction, and momentum. When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it indicates bullish momentum, and when it crosses below, it suggests bearish momentum. The histogram helps visualize the distance between the MACD and signal lines."
  },
  {
    "indicator": "ATR",
    "description": "The Average True Range (ATR) measures market volatility by calculating the average of true price ranges over a specific period. It provides insight into how much a stock typically moves over a day, without indicating direction.",
    "use": "ATR is used by traders to gauge volatility and to set appropriate stop-loss levels. A higher ATR value indicates higher volatility, while a lower value suggests less volatility. It’s particularly useful in volatile markets for risk management."
  },
  {
    "indicator": "RSI",
    "description": "The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100, with readings above 70 considered overbought and below 30 considered oversold.",
    "use": "RSI is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions, which can indicate potential reversals. Traders use it to time their entries and exits, especially during trending markets. It also helps in spotting divergences, where price moves in the opposite direction of RSI."
  },
  {
    "indicator": "OBV",
    "description": "On-Balance Volume (OBV) is a momentum indicator that uses volume flow to predict changes in stock prices. It calculates cumulative volume by adding or subtracting volume on up days and down days, respectively.",
    "use": "OBV helps to confirm trends and signals potential reversals. A rising OBV indicates accumulation, suggesting that buyers are more active, while a falling OBV indicates distribution, suggesting that sellers are more active. It’s often used in conjunction with price action to validate breakouts."
  },
  {
    "indicator": "Stochastic Oscillator",
    "description": "The Stochastic Oscillator compares a stock's closing price to its price range over a specific period, typically 14 days. It consists of two lines, %K and %D, which oscillate between 0 and 100 to indicate momentum.",
    "use": "The Stochastic Oscillator is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. Readings above 80 suggest the stock may be overbought, while readings below 20 suggest it may be oversold. It helps in spotting potential reversals or trend continuations."
